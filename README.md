# Image-learning
Image learning using Convolution Neural Networks

Path of files and file names to be updated before running.

To view the live flow of the training process using tensorboard, run the command 'tensorboard --logdir=PATH_OF_LOGS_DIR_GIVEN_IN_LINE_93'

To run the training only once, comment the lines from 83-121 and uncomment lines 62-83

To run the training with specifications of number of dense layers, size of layer, number of convolution layers - uncomment the lines 81-121 and comment the line 62-83
